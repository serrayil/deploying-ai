Notably, 95% of organizations reported no measurable ROI, with only 5% of integrated AI pilots delivering significant value to their operations. Adoption rates for tools like ChatGPT have surged, yet this high usage correlates primarily with increases in individual productivity rather than overarching organizational performance improvements.\\n\\nQuantitative data underscores that while 80% of organizations have piloted or considered GenAI solutions, nearly 40% have deployed such tools. However, a mere 5% of custom enterprise AI solutions have been successfully transitioned from pilot programs to production stages. Sector-specific analyses reveal that Media & Telecom and Technology rank highest in disruption, while Healthcare and Energy exhibit minimal structural changes despite high adoption rates. Furthermore, 90% of surveyed enterprises have explored AI solutions, with half purchasing official subscriptions for large language models (LLMs).\\n\\nKey barriers to effective implementation are identified, including misalignment of AI tools with existing workflows, limited contextual learning capabilities, and poor feedback retention practices. Furthermore, the governance structure within organizations poses additional challenges, notably a paradox wherein larger firms excel in piloting but struggle to scale successful AI implementations. Investment bias towards front-office functions like Sales and Marketing, which consume approximately 70% of AI budgets, exacerbates the underutilization of back-office operations that could yield higher ROI.\\n\\nAmid these findings, organizational capabilities vary significantly, with companies exhibiting lower success rates when relying on internal tool development compared to those engaging in strategic partnerships for AI deployment. This impotence in scaling AI capabilities is further revealed through the insight that organizations with decentralized decision-making frameworks tend to achieve higher deployment success rates.\\n\\nTo enhance ROI, organizations are encouraged to prioritize investments in back-office automation and develop tailored solutions that address specific business needs. Moreover, as GenAI adoption engenders varied organizational impacts, there is an emergent need for frameworks to manage AI systems effectively in this rapidly evolving landscape. Future strategies should focus on nurturing partnerships, ensuring data readiness, and fostering a culture of adaptability and continuous learning in alignment with AI advancements.', Tone='Bureaucratese', InputTokens=4324, OutputTokens=542)"

      "  - actual output: In an assessment of generative AI (GenAI) implementation across various sectors, it has been determined that there is a significant disparity between the substantial investment of approximately $30-40 billion in GenAI initiatives and the consequential returns realized by organizations. Notably, 95% of organizations reported no measurable ROI, with only 5% of integrated AI pilots delivering significant value to their operations. Adoption rates for tools like ChatGPT have surged, yet this high usage correlates primarily with increases in individual productivity rather than overarching organizational performance improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantitative data underscores that while 80% of organizations have piloted or considered GenAI solutions, nearly 40% have deployed such tools. However, a mere 5% of custom enterprise AI solutions have been successfully transitioned from pilot programs to production stages. Sector-specific analyses reveal that Media & Telecom and Technology rank highest in disruption, while Healthcare and Energy exhibit minimal structural changes despite high adoption rates. Furthermore, 90% of surveyed enterprises have explored AI solutions, with half purchasing official subscriptions for large language models (LLMs).\n",
      "\n",
      "Key barriers to effective implementation are identified, including misalignment of AI tools with existing workflows, limited contextual learning capabilities, and poor feedback retention practices. Furthermore, the governance structure within organizations poses additional challenges, notably a paradox wherein larger firms excel in piloting but struggle to scale successful AI implementations. Investment bias towards front-office functions like Sales and Marketing, which consume approximately 70% of AI budgets, exacerbates the underutilization of back-office operations that could yield higher ROI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amid these findings, organizational capabilities vary significantly, with companies exhibiting lower success rates when relying on internal tool development compared to those engaging in strategic partnerships for AI deployment. This impotence in scaling AI capabilities is further revealed through the insight that organizations with decentralized decision-making frameworks tend to achieve higher deployment success rates.\n",

Moreover, as GenAI adoption engenders varied organizational impacts, there is an emergent need for frameworks to manage AI systems effectively in this rapidly evolving landscape. Future strategies should focus on nurturing partnerships, ensuring data readiness, and fostering a culture of adaptability and continuous learning in alignment with AI advancements.\n",

    "To improve the summary, I used the three elements already produced in the workflow: the report notes (context), the draft summary and the evaluation feedback. Particularly, I focused on the SummarizationReason to understand where alignment or coverage was weak. I then rewrote the prompt so the model acted like a careful editor, and I required it to stick strictly to the source notes, remove unsupported claims, preserve all quantitative figures exactly, maintain the Bureaucratese tone and stay concise. This helped directly address the hallucination and accuracy issues.\n",

    "I evaluated the revised summary using the same DeepEval setup to keep the comparison consistent. The improved version performed better because it was grounded in the extracted facts and avoided adding extra interpretation. While these controls reduce hallucinations and improve reliability, they are not perfect. "
